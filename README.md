 - Experience in game (reach 30k waves yourself at least).

## Installation

 - Read instrcutions carefully before use. You can find them in `gca_guide.pdf` in script's root folder.
 - Open App folder, and find `gca.exe`. Create desktop shortcut for it, and run. Do not remove it from its folder, and do not remove any other file from there.
