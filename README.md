# [Grow castle](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.raongames.growcastle) autobot

## Requirements:
 - 64-bit Windows OS
 - 1920x1080 monitor. The script can still run on smaller monitors, but it wasn’t tested. There may be problems with smaller monitors.
 - Nox android emulator installed. The script was tested with NoxPlayer 7.0.6.2.
 - Good computer performance. Grow castle should run at least 30 fps stable with required window size.
 - Experience in game (reach 30k waves yourself at least).

## Installation
 - Go to [releases list](https://github.com/Silpux/GrowCastleAutobot/releases), and download latest one. Do not download source code – it’s wrong archive.
 - Unzip it to folder dedicated for script.
 - Read instrcutions carefully before use. You can find them in `gcAutobot_guide.pdf` in script's root folder.
 - Open App folder, and find `gca_clicker.exe`. Create desktop shortcut for it, and run. Do not remove it from its folder, and do not remove any other file from there.
